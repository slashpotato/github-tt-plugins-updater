## How it works?
Plugin checks if version of this plugin's or any other slashpotato's plugin version is same to plugin version in `version.json`. This plugin is able to update itself or any other (by hand). You just enter updater's GUI and select which ones to update and press update. Then you can restart game. Plugin gets all plugins list with github links from `plugins-list.json` from this repo in `release` branch.
### Plans:
1. Making it able to select update channel: release or nightly
